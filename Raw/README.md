# What's in the Raw folder?

## Folders starting with FOIA or "raw dump"

We have two sets of twin folders:

+ FOIA_April2016
+ FOIA_February201
+ FOIA_May2016
+ raw dump April2016
+ raw dump Feburary201
+ raw dump May2016

These two sets of twin folders are duplicates. One is Rajiv's subfolder and the other is Bocar's subfolder. We need to see if there are any differences, merge these together, and only use one.

## Complaints folder

This is the data file that powers https://cpdb.co/.git
