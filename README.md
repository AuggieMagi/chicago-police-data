# Chicago Police Incidents Data

## What is this?

This is a living repository of public data about Chicagoâ€™s police officers and their encounters with the public, maintained by the Invisible Institute and other volunteers from the Chicago community. The datasets deal with several different categories of incidents, including shootings, use-of-force, complaints of misconduct, and open investigations by the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA). 

This repository also serves as a hub to facilitate the Chicago community's efforts to use the data in the interest of promoting police accountability. Interactions are primarily coordinated via the repository's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/invinst/shootings-data/issues) and organized using labels. 

More specific details about the datasets here are discussed later in this readme. 

## Where did it come from?

The original data and documents are all sourced directly from the Chicago Police Department (CPD), the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), or the City of Chicago. The raw files were released pursuant to [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) requests made by the Invisible Institute and its partners. Scraped data from the [IPRA data portal](http://portal.iprachicago.org/) is also included.

## Why is it relevant right now?

Police accountability and misconduct has long been a major issue in Chicago, with the [Invisible Institute](https://cpdb.co/story/) working on it for more than a decade. It has gained especially increased attention after the [October 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shooting_of_Laquan_McDonald) and is an active issue being investigated and worked on by the community, the city government, and even the U.S. Department of Justice.
